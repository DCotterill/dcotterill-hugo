I live on the Northern Beaches of Sydney with my wife and 2 kids, since 
moving from England in 2001.

After a career of about 20 years in IT related roles (Programmer, Tech Lead, 
Project Manager, Development Manager), I decided to stop working for a while 
and semi-retire, mainly while my kids are young and still want to spend time 
with me.

I still love technology and a little bit of coding when I can, occasionally 
picking up pet projects. I try to get my kids involved when I can, and I run 
a Code Club at their primary school (link)

I'm a keen trail runner to keep fit and to have fun. My local run is Manly 
Dam, or down at Manly Beach, and I've entered loads of trail races, with the 
toughest challenge the UTA 100km in the Blue Mountains. 

At the moment I'm happy not working, but if I find something I'm super 
passionate about that balances well with my personal time, I might consider 
it at some point. Maybe when the kids are more independent.

Hope you enjoy reading something here!
