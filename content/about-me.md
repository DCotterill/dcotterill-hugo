Hi! I'm Darren, and I live on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia.

I've spent my career in various IT / programming roles, and I still love to tinker with technology, Now I describe myself as 'semi-retired' i.e. I don't have a job, but my wife runs her own business(es).

Although I often get asked 'what do you do all day?', we have 2 school age children, and the days get filled quicker than you'd imagine. I feel like I consume a lot of material and learn a lot, so I've setup this site to try and force myself to share some of the things I learn.

I still get a lot of satisfaction from programming and building things, but these days I find it difficult to get motivated to do it without a real purpose to the project I'm working on.

I'm massively into personal finance, investing, especially the FIRE community. It saddens me when I see the financial illiteracy all around us, and the tragic mistakes people make.

Health and fitness play a big role in my life. My wife runs a Nutrition business, and together we learn a lot about health, food, exercise, etc., and how to be healthier. I'm an avid runner, but less so these days than my previous Ultra-marathon years.

Most of my posts will probably be around these topics, but I occasionally get fascinated by something completely different, and spend my time going deeper than I probably should.

Hope you enjoy some of the content.
